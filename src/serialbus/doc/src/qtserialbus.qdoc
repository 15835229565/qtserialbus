    \title Qt Serial Bus
    \brief Provides framework and implementartion for SocketCAN an potentially other serial buses.

    The Qt Serial Bus API provides access to socketCAN via C++ interface.
    Module is designed and named thus it can be extended with any serial bus backend.

    Currently the API is supported on \l{http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linux.html}{Linux}

    \section1 Information about classes

    QSerialBus
    The QSerialBus class handles registration and creation of bus backends.

    QSerialBusDevice
    Interface between the module user and the actual bus. Inherited from QIODevice.

    QCanBusDevice
    Inherited from QSerialBusDevice. Designed to work with SocketCanBackend.
    QCanBusDevice takes ownership of QSerialBusBackend given in object creation.

    QSerialBusDeviceFilter
    Acts as an interpreter for data read by the QSerialBusDevice.

    QBusDeviceBackend
    The backend is the access point to the actual device.
    It is responsible for the bit/byte level communication with the hardware and also providing
    the data and notifications to the QSerialBusDevice

    \section2 Minimal application example

    \code
        QSerialBus *serialBus = QSerialBus::Instance();
        QBusDeviceBackend *socketCanBackend = serialBus->createBackend("can", "socketcan");
        QCanBusDevice *socketCanDevice = new QCanBusDevice(socketCanBackend, this);

        socketCanDevice->open(QIODevice::ReadWrite);

        //Write frame (id, data, size in bytes)
        socketCanDevice->writeFrame(12, 32, 1);
    \endcode
