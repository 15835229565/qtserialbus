Method for asking connection state and proper signaling should be added.

Buffer for socketCAN backend should be added so that read can be non-blocking

Documentation should be done properly for everything.

Check d pointer pattern with qserialbus / qserialbusdevice / qcanbusdevice

Example app should be cleaned up. It is bit too convoluted because of iterative implementation method. Also defined flags from socket CAN header should not be used.
